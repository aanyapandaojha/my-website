  <h1>Poems</h1>

  <h2>Dessert</h2>
  I love food, <br>
  But after that I feel like a treat, <br>
  What should i eat? <br>
  A donut, <br>
  A candy, <br>
  And some edible sheets! <br>

  <h3>Aanya (my name)</h3>
  Aanya loves art, <br>
  Aanya is awsome, <br>
  Not the best at bowling, <br>
  Yum, I love cookies, <br>
  Aanya also does Aanya fun! <br>

  <h4>My white Teddy Bear </h4>
  Oh White teddy bear, Oh white teddy bear, <br>
  Why do I care, You are shiny white every day <br>
  You shine even in the hay, And you will always be my white teddy bear, <br>
  You can shine at night, And when I hold you tight, <br>
  I can't say a single thing about my white teddy bear, Because its favorite fruit is a pear! <br>
  It's to exciting to lie, but When you see it, You always have to say , Goodbye <br>

  <h5>My Happyness</h5>
  Sadness, Sadness, What do we do? <br>
  Just ask your mom and you will find out! <br>
  You play, do art and play outside with your friends and family! <br>
  Soon your sad face will flip upside down! <br>
  Aaaaaaand, always remember to have HAPPYNESS! <br>
